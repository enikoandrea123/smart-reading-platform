        <h2>ðŸ’¡ A Note From the Founder</h2>
        <p>
          "ShelfMate started as my final thesis project, born out of a deep love for books and technology.
          As someone who has always been captivated by the power of stories, I envisioned a platform that not only
          recommends books tailored to each reader but also makes tracking your reading journey intuitive and enjoyable.
          <br />
          <br />
          Building ShelfMate has been a solo endeavor, blending my passion for programming with the art of storytelling.
          I hope this platform inspires you to read more, discover hidden gems, and connect with the magic of books.
          <br />
          <br />
          Thank you for being part of this journey. Letâ€™s create smarter shelves, one book at a time!"
